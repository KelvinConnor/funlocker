# FunLocker Prototype - CAD Design 

Simple 3D printable locking mechanism design to use a cheap 5v servo to drive/retract a slide. 
This was meant as learning/development exercise interfacing an Arduino/ESP32 with a mobile application via Bluetooth.
The device could be made much more compact if desired. The design was meant to be easily accessed via an open body - the cover was going to just be attached by hook/loop or similar but was never was finalized. I ended up installing an initial prototype and found it would well enough for my needs. Ideally the design needs a better designed cover and a more integrated PCB.

I printed out the component parts (sans cover) using PLA which was more then adequate for my needs (basic deterrent and tamper evidence).
